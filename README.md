# nba_GOATS

This purpose of this project is to compare players who are considered to be among the best players of all-time (commonly known as "GOATs") in the NBA. It does so in terms of various statistics that measure how well they played in the NBA, and it mainly uses ggplot2 and dplyr, which make up the tidyverse of R.
